Executes PHP code on WordPress default Text Widget

== Description ==

PHP Text Widget modifies the standard Text Widget of WordPress making it able to
execute PHP code.

The normal behaviour of the text widget is preserved so it can be activated without
fear.

That let the blog owner to control the text displayed
with PHP, eg. showing different ads on different posts, pages, categories and so on.

I'm using it on few blogs where a sidebar located ads has to be shown only for posts
in a particular category.
